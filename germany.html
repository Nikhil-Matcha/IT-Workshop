        <p style="width: 80%;">Germany was on the losing side in WW1 and was wrecked by the treaty of Versailes. The winners of World war 1 demanded huge money from Germany as a compensation. As Germany didn't have any, USA lent some money to repay the debts. But with the great economic depression in 1929, USA suddenly wanted their money back. So Germany started printing more of thier currency, which lead to huge downfall of German Mark's value. Then Hitler came to power in 1933 and fixed everything using in-human ways. The ethnic Germans (Aryan race) were considered to be the most superior in the world and all other races were suppressed in everyway. Many Jews were sent to concentration camps, where they were treated very cruelly, as they were considered inferior. Anyone who opposed were killed. During Hitler's regime, several thousands of Jews were killed.</p>

    <p>Then Hitler focused on improving the military. He completely violated the treaty of Versailes and started the first luftwaffe squadron. He even moved troops to the Rhineland, into which the entry of German army is prohibited according to the treaty of Versailes.</p>
    <p>The Nazi regime dominated neighbours through military threats in the years leading up to war. Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if these were not met. It seized Austria and almost all of Czechoslovakia in 1938 and 1939. Germany signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union and invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, launching World War II in Europe.</p>

        <p style="width: 90%;">Against the advice of many of his senior military officers, Hitler ordered an attack on France and the Low Countries, which began in May 1940. They quickly conquered Luxembourg and the Netherlands. After outmanoeuvring the Allies in Belgium and forcing the evacuation of many British and French troops at Dunkirk, France fell as well, surrendering to Germany on 22 June. The victory in France resulted in an upswing in Hitler's popularity and an upsurge in war fever in Germany.</p>

    <p>Hitler even tried to invade Britain but the superiority of the Royal Navy and organized defence saved Britain. In February 1941, the German Afrika Korps arrived in Libya to aid the Italians in the North African Campaign. On 6 April, Germany launched an invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece. All of Yugoslavia and parts of Greece were subsequently divided between Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Bulgaria.</p>
    <p>On 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotovâ€“Ribbentrop Pact, about 3.8 million Axis troops attacked the Soviet Union, making it the largest land based invasion. While the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 was initially successful, the Soviet resurgence and entry of the United States into the war meant that the Wehrmacht (German armed forces) lost the initiative on the Eastern Front in 1943 and by late 1944 had been pushed back to the pre-1939 border. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the Axis powers were driven back in Eastern and Southern Europe. After the Allied invasion of France, Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from the east and the other Allies from the west, and capitulated in May 1945. Hitler committed suicide and the Germany surrendered on 8th May 1945.</p>
