        <p style="width: 80%;">Germany was on the losing side in WW1 and was wrecked by the treaty of Versailes. The winners of World war 1 demanded huge money from Germany as a compensation. As Germany didn't have any, USA lent some money to repay the debts. But with the great economic depression in 1929, USA suddenly wanted their money back. So Germany started printing more of thier currency, which lead to huge downfall of German Mark's value. Then Hitler came to power in 1933 and fixed everything using in-human ways. The ethnic Germans (Aryan race) were considered to be the most superior in the world and all other races were suppressed in everyway. Many Jews were sent to concentration camps, where they were treated very cruelly, as they were considered inferior. Anyone who opposed were killed. During Hitler's regime, several thousands of Jews were killed.</p>
