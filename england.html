    <p>England, along with France, declared war on Germany on September 1942, after the German's invasion of Poland. They started a naval blockade on Germany because of their superior navy. But didn't invest much in land based troops. When Germany planned an offensive against Netherlands and belgium, British moved only 300,000 troops while French mobilized millions. After the historic evacuation in Dunkirk, and the fall of France, Britain was all alone against the much stronger Germany. Adding to their problems, Italy too declared war on Britain. The British government even considered signing peace talks with the axis powers inorder to save Britain from invasion.</p>
    <p>Still, Winston Churchill, surprisingly, was all in for the war. The British defended against German air-rides in the battle of Britain. The Battle of Britain costed Germany many aircrafts and they lost several trained pilots which they couldn't replace. it costed very much for Britain too, but the US supplied them with weapons.</p>
    <p>Several commonwealth nations supported the British, which proved to be very important for the Great Britain, especially in their African campaigns. After the US entry into war, the allied airforce ruled the skies. The Royal airforce provided sufficient air cover during the Normandy landings. It also played a crucial role during the airraids on Berlin.</p>

    <p>With the help of US and the commonwealth nations, the British squeezed Germany out of Africa. The British also lead the forces during the invasion of Greece. After the success of Normandy landings, the allies liberated France from Germany. By 5 March 1945, the Canadian, British, and American forces had closed up to the Rhine in all but a small salient on their sectors of the front. That salient was reduced by five days later.</p>
    <p>The British then liberated Belgium and Netherlands. British units reached the Baltic on 2 May, and then halted as they had reached the agreed line of meeting Soviet forces. The war came to an end on 7 May, and British forces reoriented to the task of occupying Germany itself.</p>
