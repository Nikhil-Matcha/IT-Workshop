    <p>Although the US was neutral untill the the attack on Pearl Harbour, they supplied weapons to the British, Soviet Unioun and China. During October one U.S. destroyer was damaged by a German U-boat and another was sunk. The United States now embarked on an undeclared naval war against Germany, but Roosevelt refrained from asking for a formal declaration of war. According to public opinion polls, a majority of Americans still hoped to remain neutral.</p>

        <p>It was after the Japanese attacked the Pearl Harbour, US officially entered the war on 8th December 1941. At that time, the United States had some 2,200,000 men under arms, but most were ill-trained and poorly equipped. Barely a handful of army divisions even approached a state of readiness. The Army Air Corps possessed only 1,100 combat planes, many of which were outdated. The navy was better prepared, but it was too small to fight a two-ocean war and had barely been able to provide enough ships for convoy duty in the North Atlantic. Eventually more than 15,000,000 men and women would serve in the armed forces, but not until 1943 would the United States be strong enough to undertake large-scale offensive operations. </p>

        <p>The US, with the support of Australian navy, successfully defended the Australian coast in the battle of Coral sea, even though they were out-numbered. Then the won the Battle of Midway, in which they destroyed 4 of the 6 japanese aircraft carriers, which were the major strength of Japan. Then the successive offensive operations and the atomic bomb droppings gave them victory in the pacific theatre.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, the Germans occupied almost all of the Europe by mid 1941. The US provided supplies to the allies during the historic evacuation of Brirish and French troops at Dunkirk. The US played a major role in securing the German occupied europe. They led the historic Normandy landings in June 1944. The US captured two highly secured beaches, code named 'Utah' and 'Omaha'. After that they started driving the germans back to Berlin. The Germans were no match to the air superiority of the allies. Air bombings in Berlin became a daily routine, with the US bombing during the day and the british at night.</p>
