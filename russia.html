    <p>The Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany on 23 August 1939. In addition to stipulations of non-aggression, the treaty included a secret protocol that divided territories of Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland into German and Soviet Union "spheres of influence", anticipating potential "territorial and political rearrangements" of these countries. In October and November 1940, German-Soviet talks about the potential of joining the Axis took place in Berlin, nothing came from the talks since Hitler's Ideological goal was Lebensraum in the East.</p>

        <p>Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939 starting World War II, Stalin waited until September 17 before launching his own invasion of Poland. Part of the Karelia and Salla regions of Finland were annexed by the Soviet Union after the Winter War. This was followed by Soviet annexations of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and parts of Romania (Bessarabia, northern Bukovina and the Hertza region). It was known at the Nuremberg trials the existence of the secret protocol of the Germanâ€“Soviet pact regarding the planned divisions of these territories</p>

        <p>On 22 June 1941, Hitler launched an invasion of the Soviet Union. Stalin ignored the warnings from the British and the US, and hence this was a devastating blow for the red army. The Germans advanced several kilometers encircling mind boggling numbers of the Soviet army. It was not until winter that tide was turned. The soviets defended Stalingrad desperately. Even the civilians helped in building trenches around the city. It was this desperate attempt that saved the Soviet Union.</p>

    <p>With the supply of weapons from the US, the numerical superiority of the Soviet army, they stopped the German advance at around 30 km from Moscow. Then the counter-attack started. With the weakening of German army and the allied attacks in the western front, the path was clear for the red army to start an offensive. They eventually pushed back the Germans to Berlin and captured Berlin on May 1945.</p>
